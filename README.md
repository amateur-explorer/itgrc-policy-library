## 🚀 How to Use These Templates

### For Organisations Starting from Scratch
1. Start with `information-security-policy.md` — the parent policy
2. Customize the `[ORGANIZATION NAME]`, `[DATE]`, `[VERSION]` placeholders
3. Review the **Applicability** section for your sector
4. Use the **Control Mapping** table at the bottom to demonstrate compliance

### For Audit/Assessment Purposes
1. Use `frameworks/iso27001-annex-a-mapping.md` to map your controls
2. Check `frameworks/sector-regulatory-matrix.md` for your regulatory obligations
3. Run gap analysis using the checklists in each policy document

### For Consultants
- All templates are designed to be client-ready with minimal customization
- Sector notes are clearly marked — remove inapplicable sections
- Version control fields are included for change management
